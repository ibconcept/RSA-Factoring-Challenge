``# RSA-Factoring-Challenge


Alright, imagine you have a super-secret number lock that only opens when you multiply two really big prime numbers together. This special lock is called RSA, and it's like a magical shield for messages. Now, factoring in RSA is like trying to figure out what those two big prime numbers are if you only know the result of their multiplication. It's a super tricky puzzle that mathematicians love to solve. If someone manages to crack the code and figure out those prime numbers, they can unlock the secret messages protected by the RSA lock. So, it's like trying to break a secret code by figuring out the special ingredients that make it work.
